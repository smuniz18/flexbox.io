What is a Flexvbox?

The CSS3 Flexible Box, or flexbox is a layout mode intended to accommodate different screen sizes and different display devices. The display order of flexbox elements is independent of their order in the source code. Popular layouts can thus be achieved more simply and with cleaner code.

Definition of display css:
flex = the entire width of the screen
inline-flex = just the width of your content
